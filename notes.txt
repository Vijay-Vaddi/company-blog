1.Basic setup 
blog posts, users, core are main components 
each will be imported  into app.py by blueprints

so have to set up __init__.py in all components to imported to other components or app.py
python needs this to understand that its a module that can be imporrted
***__init__ can be empty, its just to let python know its a module to be imported. 
LEARN MORE on THIS. 

#core will have home and info view so view.py
#blogs needs forms as well so forms.py file in blog component

#core doesnt need any forms, its just a main page with some views

#users need views and forms for adding/updating users. 

#picture handler has to be added for user profile image handling

#error_pages will have views to show 404 error_pages

#templates --- all templates go there for this project

#__init__ file under company blog will hold lot of organizational logic, 
conneting bluprints, connecting login manager, components everything togher
that will help us organize so when we run app.py we can just import app from company-blog and run it.
